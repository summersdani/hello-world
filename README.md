Hello Coders!

I started my coding journey in 2014 when I was a freshman in college. I wanted a blog site to go along with my YouTube channel but I hated all of the free templates that Blogger and Wordpress offered. I started doing research and created my first website using a text editor, HTML and CSS. A few months later, I made a static website for a Sheriff Candidate (although I new nothing about security at the time). Now I am a senior majoring in Information Systems and I work for a digital media company making websites using WordPress and amazon web servers. My goal is to continue learning and evolving with technology and to never remain static.
